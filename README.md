# Eight
## Once-per-day, no-frills daily reflection journal.

[Try it here!](https://eightoclock.vercel.app)

A little bit of self-reflection every day doesn't have to be a tedius exercise in long-form journaling and / or meditation. A quick, once-per-day option to help you remember to pause and reflect on the positives and negatives of the day is all that is needed to identify how to make improvements on how you spend your time.

Eight is a tool that I built after setting a daily iOS reminder to ask myself "What did you do today?" every day at 8pm. It was a simple question that I could answer to myself even while I was doing something else, without needing to write it down. Having a lightweight tool to track these reflections over time felt like a great way to help people reflect on their own day, and to make daily reflection an easy habit to adopt.
